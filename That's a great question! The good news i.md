That's a great question! The good news is no, you don't need to switch to other timeframes in order for them to save updated data to their respective arrays.
The way your code is currently structured, every time new 5-second data arrives:
The dataArrays['5S'] array is updated directly.
The resampleData function is called for every timeframe other than '5S' to resample the new data into the corresponding resolution (1 minute, 3 minutes, etc.).
The resampled data is then appended to the respective timeframe array (dataArrays['1'], dataArrays['3'], etc.).
This process happens regardless of which timeframe the user is currently viewing on the chart. So, even if the user is only looking at the 5-second chart, the data for all other timeframes is being updated in the background.
Benefits of this approach:
Data readiness: When the user does switch to a different timeframe, the data is already aggregated and ready to be displayed, making the transition seamless.
Efficient resource usage: You avoid unnecessary resampling operations if the user never actually views certain timeframes.
Potential considerations:
Memory usage: If you have a large amount of data and many supported timeframes, the dataArrays object could become quite large in memory. You might need to implement strategies to manage this if it becomes a concern (e.g., limiting the amount of historical data stored or using a more efficient data structure).
Overall, your current implementation is efficient and ensures that all timeframe arrays are updated as new data arrives, even if the user is not actively viewing those timeframes.

You're describing a behavior where, even though the data for higher timeframes is being aggregated, the chart doesn't seem to display the complete data from the beginning when you switch to those timeframes after a certain amount of time has passed on the 5-second chart.
This is likely not a direct resampling issue. The resampling logic itself seems to be working correctly. The problem is most likely related to how TradingView requests and handles historical data, particularly when switching between resolutions with a significant amount of accumulated data.
Here's what's probably happening:
Initial 5-second data: When the chart loads, TradingView requests a certain amount of historical 5-second data (controlled by the visible range and the library's internal logic). This data is used to populate the initial view.
Realtime updates: As new 5-second data comes in, it's displayed in real-time, and the higher timeframe arrays are also updated in the background.
Switching to a higher timeframe: When you switch to, for example, the 1-minute timeframe, TradingView again requests historical data, but this time for the 1-minute resolution.
Limited history request: TradingView likely requests only a limited amount of 1-minute historical data, starting from a point relatively close to the current time. It's possible that this request doesn't go back far enough to retrieve all the 1-minute data that has been aggregated from the beginning of the 5-second stream.
Solution:
You can try to address this in a couple of ways:
1. Override getBars behavior for initial higher timeframe requests:
You can modify your getBars function to detect when it's the first request for a higher timeframe (similar to how you handle the initial 5S request).
In this case, instead of filtering based on from and to, return the entire corresponding timeframe array (dataArrays['1'], dataArrays['3'], etc.).
This will ensure that TradingView receives all the aggregated data from the beginning for that timeframe, even if its initial request doesn't go back that far.
getBars: (symbolInfo, resolution, periodParams, onHistoryCallback, onErrorCallback) => {
    // ... (rest of the function)

    if (resolution !== '5S' && firstDataRequest) {
        // If it's the first request for a non-5S timeframe, return the entire array
        const bars = dataArrays[resolution];
        console.log(`[getBars]: returned entire ${resolution} array (${bars.length} bar(s))`, bars);
        onHistoryCallback(bars, { noData: bars.length === 0 });
    } else {
        // ... (rest of your getBars logic for filtering)
    }
},
Use code with caution.

2. Implement a "Load More" mechanism:
If you want to avoid sending potentially large amounts of data upfront, you can implement a "Load More" button or functionality within your TradingView chart.
When the user clicks "Load More," you can make a separate request to your datafeed to retrieve older data for the current timeframe and append it to the chart.
Additional considerations:
TradingView's internal behavior: It's important to note that TradingView's internal data loading and caching mechanisms can be complex and might vary depending on factors like the library version, chart settings, and user interactions. Experimentation and careful observation might be needed to find the most reliable solution for your specific setup.
